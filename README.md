## Things I'm poking at

* Maintaining [Voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom), Gradle tooling for decade-old Minecraft Forge versions
* experimenting with [cursed Gradle megaprojects](https://github.com/quat1024/AutoThirdPerson) to ease the updating and backporting workload
* Worked on [Packages](https://github.com/quat1024/packages), [Apathy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apathy-mod), [Boat with Everything](https://github.com/quat1024/boat-with-everything), Incorporeal [1](https://github.com/quat1024/incorporeal) [2](https://github.com/quat1024/incorporeal-2-forge) and [3](https://github.com/quat1024/incorporeal-3), [hoppers](https://github.com/quat1024/hoppers), [Dokokashira Door](https://github.com/quat1024/dokokashira-door), and [a bunch of other Minecraft projects](https://www.curseforge.com/members/quat1024/projects) that I will get around to updating eventually please be patient :pray: :pray:!!
